# C Basecamp @ 42saopaulo
This repository contains coding developed at 42saopaulo's C bootcamp.

About 42:

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Basecamp", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

# C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Basecamp is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

# Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.

Soft-skills

# Self-learning and proactiveness
	At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
	are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
	your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

# Teamwork
	On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
	chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
	The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
	common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.
